# Welcome on board ‚ò†Ô∏è

As a one of our new cabin boys we have some tests for you to show us what a pirate can become out of you. Like a real pirate you must find your way by yourselve sometimes. We give you only some little hints to get the üîë to our pirate ship.

## What you need

You need some basic knowledge about
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## 1. Hotel list

We need for our next trip with the whole ‚ò†Ô∏è-crew a hotel and what we get from our backend-üêµ was only [this](http://fake-hotel-api.herokuapp.com/).

Your task is now to present us the hotels, that we can choose the right one for our next trip. To make it easier for us to find the right hotel, we want to have a filter for hotel ‚≠ê (stars) and hotel üí∞ (price).

### Technology

You can choose whatever you want. A library, a framework, plugins or your own prepared skeleton which you love to start with.

### Design

We have no requirements for design. No colors, no mockups, nothing. Please feel free to inspire us with everything you think this list of hotels needs to be perfect in case of UX and UI.

### Requirements

Your final code should be packed as a ZIP file and include every asset (images, data files,... [no node_modules folder please]) which we need to run the presentation on local. Besides all assets we need a README.md where we find a step by step introduction to run your code in a perfect and clean way.

### Hints

* We are modern pirates and love to navigate with our mobile devices too. Please optimize your presentation on all modern devices
* On our trips we want to have it more comfortable and the default hotel list should have minimum 3 ‚≠ê.
* You will find a lot of data and informations for one hotel. Show us you what you think is really important to present.
* Pirates love to share their knowledge! Please find a way to show for every hotel also the reviews, that we know what other pirates thing about the hotel.

## 2. The Flight

To get to our hotel we also need a flight. But here our backend-üêµ has no idea how he can start with the development.

Your second task is to explain our backend-üêµ what you need from him as a data structure for an API endpoint.

Here you are completly free how the data structure should look like and which format it should have. Think about what you need to show us also a flight list where we can search flight to our hotel.

Please describe with your own words what you need and give us a short example with dummy data how your data structure will look like.
